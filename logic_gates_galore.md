# Welcome to Logic Gates, home of the 74LS series, and the 6502!
## 74LS Series
The 74LS series is a family of logic gates, originally developed by Texas Instruments. You can build your own 8 bit computer out of them, (just like ben eater). These chips were the "function prototypes" of what the 6502/65C02, and later on the 8066, would build upon.
